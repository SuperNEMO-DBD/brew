# SuperNEMO-DBD Homebrew

Due to Homebrew's move to only supporting binary installs, removing options, and
not allowing core formulae to be overriden in pinned Taps, SuperNEMO is migrating
to use of the [Spack Package Manager](https://spack.io).

To provide temporary support during Spack testing, we have forked upstream Linuxbrew to
enable restoration of needed build-from-source and changes to core formulae.
